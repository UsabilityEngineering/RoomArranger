# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

## Introduction



RoomArrangerâ€™s goal is to aid in the process of interior layout and design. Users will be able to create a digital model of a room and determine the most practical furniture locations without needing to waste time and energy physically moving furniture. Potential layouts will be easily shared between users. 
In this final interval, our group will focus on advancing our wireframes into the prototype phase in preparation for user testing. Accordingly, maximizing functionality and finalizing visual aspects of the program are our team's main focus points during this phase. 

## Methods

Our user test included five individuals from a pseudo-random sample of college students.

We tasked each of the individuals with completing various tasks in an effort to gauge the effectiveness of our user
interface design.

We performed the tests in this fashion such that the users could get comfortable with the design elements of the user
interface before proceeding to the more advanced steps.

1. Users were first prompted to create an account.
    - This was an expectedly trivial introduction exercise that acted as a baseline for the user's performance.
    - This step helped familiarize the user with the interface style, additionally allowing them to become more
      accustomed to the controls
      of the computer they were operating for the tests.
2. We then asked the subjects to position windows, doors, and closets within a floor plan after creating a new project.
    - This step used a simple predefined room layout with clearly labeled layout attributes.
    - We kept the reference the same between all tests.
3. Subjects were then prompted to add furniture according to the reference layout.
    - This test started with the completed layout from step 2, not relying on the user's previous completion.
    - Using another simplified reference document, users were prompted to add furniture to the room.
4. Subjects were prompted to then share the floor plan that was created according to the reference document.
    - This step does not rely on the completion of the previous steps, but is presented in a state replicating the
      completed layout of the above steps.

After the conclusion of each step, we cataloged the completion status and the user's difficulty rating on a scale of 1
to 5 (one is very easy, five is very difficult).

## Findings

Users were impressed with the cleanliness and sophistication of the prototype.

- All users rated the user experience difficulty for creating an account and signing in as "Extremely Easy", or a 1 on
  the difficulty rating spectrum.
    - Everyone was able to complete this step in a timely manner without apparent confusion.
    - One participant, P1, said "the sign-up is very easy"
- The entirety of the subjects also found it quite easy to create a new project and add layout elements.
    - All users were able to create a new project quickly.
    - One user had difficulty distinguishing between the closet doors and bedroom doors. They suggested adding
      labels beneath the icons.
    - 4/5 users rated the difficulty as "Extremely Easy" (1), with one user rating the experience as "Easy" (2).
- Users had little difficulty in learning how to add furniture to the room layout, but the icons could be confusing for
  some.
    - One user, P3 said "the icons should have descriptions", another user, P5 said they were not sure which icons to
      choose for some steps.
    - Three users found the step "Extremely Easy" (1), though one user found the step to be "Average" (3), and another
      rated it as "Easy" (2).
    - One user seemed to know how to complete the task, but made no effort to try after noting the lack of icon
      descriptions.
- The final step of sharing the completed layout, first by downloading a file, then by emailing the project got mixed
  results.
    - Some users were unable to correlate any of the toolbar button icons with sharing.
        - Users resorted to hovering over icons to see which ones they could click.
        - Other users used the process of elimination, clicking through each dropdown until they found the correct menu.
        - The median difficulty score was "Extremely Easy" (1) for three participants, but the step garnered an "
          Average" (3) score from one participant, and an "Easy" (2) score from another.
        

## Conclusions

- The reoccurring theme throughout the user test was the ambiguity of the icons on the editor page. Whether the user was
  trying to select a type of door, window, or fixture, or selecting furniture, they found difficulty in identifying the
  correct items.
- Layout and furniture icons will be updated to more accurately represent their respective items.
- Some of the "mystery meat menu" drop down menus in the toolbar will be labeled directly or will include more
  descriptive tooltips when the user hovers over them with their mouse.
- All user tests resulted in effective navigation through the series of menus with little guesswork.
    - This demonstrated an overall learnable UX design with salient icons and buttons.
    - The "share" button was ambiguous and didn't have a recognizable icon. This button will be made larger and will use
      a more recognizable icon in the future. This will hopefully make the UI more salient in conjunction with the
      addition of the aforementioned tooltips.
- Users that had previous experience with other room layout programs noted that RoomArranger achieved a superior blend
  of functionality and simplicity than other programs. This was our initial intent since we aimed for RoomArranger to
  appeal to both personal and professional users.

## Caveats

- Our prototype's interface functionality was extremely limited by the simplicity of AdobeXD. We will not be able to
  analyze the true functionality of RoomArranger's editor until our project progresses away from AdobeXD.
    - Users could only add one piece of furniture to the layout at a time. AdobeXD only allows one overlay.
    - Additionally, users could not move the furniture around once it was placed.

- The limitations of AdobeXD also made it difficult for us to analyze the file upload/sharing aspect of RoomArranger.
