# RoomArranger

RoomArranger aims to create a new paradigm of automated furniture layouts. RoomArranger will be able to take in a room's
current layout and will be able to recommend more efficient layouts, as well as provide Feng Shui insights.

## UX Team Members

* **[Braden Nicholson](https://usabilityengineering.github.io/ux-portfolio-bradenn/)** - Made personas, user stories,
  sketches, made prototypes, created the prototype style guide, and designed aspects of the user tests.
* **[Luke Burkhardt](https://github.com/UsabilityEngineering/ux-portfolio-burkhardtluke)** - Introduction, conclusions, persona, scenario, sketches.

# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

**Executive Summary**

* Analyzed competitor software to determine possible strengths and weakness in our plan.
* Created personas to represent possible end-users for our program.
* Crafted scenarios with the personas, defining user goals, expectations, and interactions we should consider for the
  UI.
* Created wireframe layouts depicting possible UI configurations.
* Began arranging wireframe layouts to experiment with designing the user experience (UX).

# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

**Executive Summary**

**Wireframes & Visual Functionality**

- Created Wireframes to understand and demonstrate the app’s desired functionality.
- Incorporated feedback from students and software engineers to refine the design.

**Cognitive Walkthroughs & User Navigation**

- Conducted parallel cognitive walkthroughs using persona perspectives and scenarios.
- Addressed several minor navigational issues reported by student feedback.

**Layout Planner**

- We found that users struggled with visualizing the abstract functionality of the layout planner.
- We added several additional icons, images, and copy text to the editor page wireframe to aid in demonstrating the
  planner’s intended functionality.

**File Formats & Sketch Uploads**

- Most users were confused by the suggested CSV, JSON, and XML file formats for the upload feature.
- We modified the layout to only suggest importing a .roomarranger file, which will be generated when exporting a
  layout.
- Many users expected to be able to upload a drawing of their layout, despite it not being a defined feature. We have
  added the feature to the layout, but we are unsure if the development team will have the time or resources to
  implement it.

# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

**Prototype**

- We finalized the design and functionality of our mock-up prototype.
- We began implementing visual adjustments from our previous analysis.
- We added more detailed icons to help guide the users through the interface.
- We simplified interface elements that were confusing.

**User Testing**

- We created a comprehensive testing procedure for determining the efficacy of our prototype.
- Using information from previous user feedback, we designed the testing procedure to focus on user experience issue we
  found in previous iterations.

- We were able to improve many points of confusion with the user interface.
- Many more interactions patterns were added to the prototype, allowing users to have more productive interactions.
- Using the more advanced prototype, we were able to apply the user testing feedback toward specifying design parameters
  for the end product.

**Icons**

- The user testing revealed an oversight regarding the reliance on unlabeled icons within the user interface.
- Some users had a hard time making out small toolbar icons due to visual impairments.
