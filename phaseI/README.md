# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

## Introduction

RoomArranger's goal is to aid in the process of interior layout and design. Users will be able to create a digital model of a room and determine the most practical furniture locations without needing to waste time and energy physically moving furniture. Potential layouts will be easily shared between users. RoomArranger will also be able to analyze a room's current physical arrangement and suggest effective layouts using Feng Shui principles.

## Methods

**Competitive Analysis**

In order to better establish where RoomArranger should strive to fit into the current marketplace, we sought to find and
analyze some potential competitors. The target demographic for similar applications is diverse, ranging from personal-use homeowners to commercial-use contractors. None of these existing applications possess the ability to analyze rooms and provide the user with layout suggestions, making the Feng Shui aspect of RoomArranger an important and unique feature.  

**Heuristic Evaluation**

From the competitive analysis, we chose the nearest competitor to evaluate in depth. During this process we evaluated
ten attributes of the competitor's applications:

- Visibility of System Status
- Match between system and the real world
- User control and freedom
- Consistency and standards
- Error prevention
- Recognition rather than recall
- Flexibility and efficiency of use
- Aesthetic and minimalist design
- Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
- Help and documentation

Using this data we were able to make determinations about some early user interface design considerations.

**Personas & Scenarios**

To get a better idea of what features and workflows users may desire from our project, we created three personas which
represent fictitious individuals from different socioeconomic backgrounds.
Along with these personas, we created various scenarios in which those personas participate in.
This exercise worked to enable a more diverse and outward understanding of the goals and motivation of potential users.

You can view the individual personas here: [Personas & Scenarios](/personas/README.md)

## Findings

We found that the user's intentions for the using the program vary widely but all resolve to the goal of creating floor
plan designs with dynamic furniture placement.

**A Dynamic Interface**

In our research, we found that it can sometimes be quite difficult to accurately translate the shape and dimensions of a
room into a web-based floor plan creator.
Since the relative sizes of the room and furniture need to be faithfully reproduces within the program to get accurate
recommendations, it is important that the interface is easy to use, and unambiguous with defining physical dimensions.

**Fault Tolerance**

While evaluating competing programs, we noted a reoccurring theme of easily losing your work.
Weather you switch between Wi-Fi networks while editing your floor plan, or just click the wrong button, it is important
that the effort you put into the program is not wasted. We found that the websites that easily lost your saved work, or
tried to make you pay to save we among the lowest ranking through all of our evaluations.

## Conclusions

**User Interface**

While most existing applications have similar user interfaces, most fail to meet the needs of the diverse demographic of users. Feature-rich examples have a cluttered and confusing interface, while examples with clean interfaces are lacking necessary features. RoomArranger will need to find an optimal blend of simplicity and features in order to effectively accommodate all potential users. 

**Feng Shui Aspect**

None of the existing room layout applications support any sort of analysis based layout suggestions. RoomArranger will need to include this feature in order to stand out and be considered by users over existing applications. 

**Errors**

Existing applications do very little to notify the user of an error and allow mistakes to be made easily. For example, if a piece of furniture is placed on top of another or in front of a doorway, the program does not send any error message to the user. This is a huge oversight in our opinion, and needs to be addressed with RoomArranger.

## Caveats

We had difficulty finding any competing software that offered the ability to arrange furniture within the confines of a
defined floor plan. Since none of the examples included analysis based Feng Shui layout suggestions, we have no basis to compare our program to. Target demographics seem to be fairly narrow for existing applications, meaning we will have to take insparation from multiple examples and combine them to meet the needs of our wide demographic of users.
