# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

## Introduction

RoomArranger was created to aid in the process of creating interior layouts and designs that conform to Feng Shui
principles. RoomArranger enables users without CAD experience to create and manage floor plans with embedded furniture
placements. This interval focused on creating a cogent user interface structure that we could use for UX design and
feature ideation.

## Methods

**Feedback from Software Engineers**

- We met with the software engineers who we walked through our wireframes.
- The software engineers demonstrated their prototype functionality, and we compared the two designs.
- Goals and features that we would like to implement were discussed with the software engineers.

**Cognitive Walkthroughs**

- We created a wireframe prototype that allowed the user to interact with the general design layout in the most basic
  sense. Users could click between pages and walk through the steps of completing certain assigned tasks.
- We assigned tasks based on the ones from our personas and scenarios.
- Users were allowed to choose their own scenario to walk through

## Findings

- One cognitive walkthrough user requested the inclusion of a “how-to” guide, so a series of hints and tips should be
  implemented into our program for new users, guiding them through the software during their first use. This will ensure
  that users are aware of all useful functions that the software provides and are able to effectively and efficiently
  navigate through them.
- The level of fidelity in our first iteration of wireframes was sufficient, except there should have been more
  instructional text to guide the users through some of the unimplementable features within the wireframe (Drag and
  Drop, etc).
- Based on cognitive walkthrough results, users were satisfied with the navigation of our wireframes and encountered no
  significant complications of confusion.
- One user was unable to locate the button linked to the profile editing page, meaning it will need to be made more
  salient.
- We found that adding specific navigational and tool clues helped guide the user to their goal.

## Conclusions

- The majority of user complaints during the cognitive walkthrough revolved around the lack of functionality rather than
  confusion regarding interface interaction. Users effectively navigated through the series of menus with little to no
  guesswork, demonstrating a limited need for visual design improvements.
- Since functionality was the main concern during user testing, we will need to converse with the software engineering
  team frequently to monitor progress and integration with our prototype.
- Some users in the student feedback session failed to grasp the complexity of a drag-and-drop interface.
- Improving iconography is a current focus as some users were confused regarding the functionality of certain (not yet
  functioning) features of the program. In addition to implementing a set of instructions/tips, the inclusion of easily
  recognizable icons will help direct the user quickly and successfully complete their current goal.

## Caveats

- The limitations of Adobe XD makes it difficult for us to analyze certain aspects of our program such as file
  upload/sharing and the actual functionality of RoomArranger’s main room layout page. We are unable to receive feedback
  on these particular aspects Until our wireframes/prototypes have been implemented with our software team’s side of the
  project.
- We are at the point in our project where making further UX progress is difficult without knowing the exact intentions
  and progress of our software engineering team. While we do have a good understanding of their goals, their execution
  of these goals could change how our side of the project progresses. frequent discourse between teams will be
  necessary.
