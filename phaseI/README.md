# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

## Introduction

!!! Describe the general problem that the project is trying to solve !!!

## Methods

!!! Describe research methods you used to discover new insights, which explains the purpose of each. Provide enough
detail that someone would be able to faithfully reproduce your research. !!!

**Competitive Analysis**

In order to better establish where RoomArranger should strive to fit into the current marketplace, we sought to find and
analyze some potential competitors.

**Heuristic Evaluation**

From the competitive analysis, we chose the nearest competitor to evaluate in depth. During this process we evaluated
ten attributes of the competitor's applications:

- Visibility of System Status
- Match between system and the real world
- User control and freedom
- Consistency and standards
- Error prevention
- Recognition rather than recall
- Flexibility and efficiency of use
- Aesthetic and minimalist design
- Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
- Help and documentation

Using this data we were able to make determinations about some early user interface design considerations.

**Personas & Scenarios**

To get a better idea of what features and workflows users may desire from our project, we created three personas which
represent fictitious individuals from different socioeconomic backgrounds.
Along with these personas, we created various scenarios in which those personas participate in.
This exercise worked to enable a more diverse and outward understanding of the goals and motivation of potential users.

You can view the individual personas here: [Personas & Scenarios](/personas/README.md)

## Findings

We found that the user's intentions for the using the program vary widely but all resolve to the goal of creating floor
plan designs with dynamic furniture placement.

**A Dynamic Interface**

In our research, we found that it can sometimes be quite difficult to accurately translate the shape and dimensions of a
room into a web-based floor plan creator.
Since the relative sizes of the room and furniture need to be faithfully reproduces within the program to get accurate
recommendations, it is important that the interface is easy to use, and unambiguous with defining physical dimensions.

**Fault Tolerance**

While evaluating competing programs, we noted a reoccurring theme of easily losing your work.
Weather you switch between Wi-Fi networks while editing your floor plan, or just click the wrong button, it is important
that the effort you put into the program is not wasted. We found that the websites that easily lost your saved work, or
tried to make you pay to save we among the lowest ranking through all of our evaluations.

**Fault Tolerance**

Using what we learned from the competitive analysis, heuristic evaluations, personas, and scenarios, we were able to
form several specific use cases for the application.

!!! For each research method, detail each of the findings point-by-point to clarify new discoveries of users' needs !!!

## Conclusions

**Wireframes**

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into
UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section,
include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

We had difficulty finding any competing software that offered the ability to arrange furniture within the confines of a
defined floor plan.

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other
words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a
particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!
