# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

## Introduction

!!! Describe the general problem that the project is trying to solve and the focus of this interval of work !!!

## Methods

!!! Describe research methods you used to discover new insights, which explains the purpose of each. Provide enough
detail that someone would be able to faithfully reproduce your research. !!!

!!! Describe your approach to your user test, including the number of participants (n=5), study design, a list of the
tasks they performed, and other data collected !!!

Our user test included five individuals from a pseudo-random sample of college students.

We tasked each of the individuals with completing various tasks in an effort to gauge the effectiveness of our user
interface design.

We preformed the tests in this fashion so that the users could get comfortable with the design elements of the user
interface, and get a preview of the button layouts they will need to use in proceeding steps.

1. Users were first prompted to create an account.
    - This was an expectedly trivial introduction exercise that acted as a baseline for the user's performance.
    - This step helped familiarize the user with the interface style helped them become more accustomed to the controls
      of the computer they were operating for the test.
2. We then asked the subjects to position windows, doors, and closets within a floor plan after creating a new project.
    - This step used a predefined simple room layout with clearly labeled layout attributes.
    - We kept the reference the same between all tests.
3. Subjects were then prompted to add furniture according to the reference layout.
    - This test starts with the completed layout from step 2, not relying on the user's previous completion.
    - Using another simplified reference document, users were prompted to add furniture to the room.
4. Subjects were prompted to then share the floor plan that was created according to the reference document.
    - This step does not rely on the completion of the previous steps, but is presented in a state replicating the
      completed layout of the above steps.

After the conclusion of each step, we cataloged the completion status and the user's difficulty rating on a scale of 1
to 5 (one is very easy, five is very difficult).

## Findings

!!! For each research method, detail each of the findings point-by-point to clarify new discoveries of users' needs !!!

For each part of the study described in the methods:

- summarize the findings point-by-point to clarify new discoveries of users' needs.
  This should describe the aggregate data and perhaps include representative [anonymized] quotes (e.g. "P1 said, 'this
  is much easier than what I've used before!")

Users were impressed with the cleanliness and sophistication of the prototype.

- All users rated the user experience difficulty for creating an account and signing in as "Extremely Easy", or a 1 on
  the difficulty rating spectrum.
    - Everyone was able to complete this step in a timely manner without apparent confusion.
    - One participant, P1, said "the sign-up is very easy"
- The entirety of the subjects also found it quite easy to create a new project and add layout elements.
    - All users were able to create a new project quickly.
    - One user said had difficulty distinguishing between the closet doors and bedroom doors. They suggested adding
      labels beneath the icons.
    - 4/5 users rated the difficulty as "Extremely Easy" (1), with one user rating the experience as "Easy" (2).
- Users had little difficulty in learning how to add furniture to the room layout, but the icons could be confusing for
  some.
    - One user, P3 said "the icons should have description", another user, P5 said they were not sure which icons to
      chose for some steps.
    - Three users found the step "Extremely Easy" (1), though one user fond the step to be "Average" (3), and another
      rated it as "Easy" (2).
    - One user seemed to know how to complete the task, but made no effort to try after noting the lack of icon
      descriptions.
- The final step of sharing the completed layout, first by downloading a file, then by emailing the project got mixed
  results.
    - Some users were unable to correlate any of the toolbar button icons with sharing.
        - Users resorted to hovering over icons to see which ones they could click.
        - Other users used the process of elimination, clicking through each dropdown until they found the correct menu.
        - The median difficulty score was "Extremely Easy" (1) for three participants, but the step garnered an "
          Average" (3) score from one participant, and a "Easy" (2) score from another.

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into
UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section,
include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

!!! Describe discoveries derived from the findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into
usability
design recommendations. Describe and/or demonstrate those recommendations and how they should shape summative
conclusions, formative revisions, and recommended future work. !!!

The reoccurring theme throughout the user test was the ambiguity of the icons on the editor page. Whether the user was
trying to select a type of door, window, or fixture, or selecting furniture, they found difficulty in identifying the
correct items.

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other
words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a
particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!

Our interface prototype's functionality was extremely limited by the simplicity of AdobeXD.

- Users could only add one piece of furniture to the layout at a time. AdobeXD only allows one overlay.
    - Additionally, users could not move the furniture around once it was placed.
