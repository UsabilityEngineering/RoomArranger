### Scenarios

- Sarah meets with a new client who wants to design the layout of their dream house. The client has grandiose plans and
  even brought their hand drawings. Sarah will need to transfer those floor plans from paper to a digital model so she
  can more effectively work on the project’s furniture layout.
- Sarah has been working on a large multi-room project and has put a lot of work into making it perfect. She is ready to
  present her project to her superiors for approval. Sarah would like to render the project to be a collection of
  high-quality images of the rooms she’s made and arranged.
- After a night out on the town, Sarah comes home a little too intoxicated. She opens up an ongoing project and in her
  inhibited wisdom, she makes drastic changes and deletes whole swathes of her projects. The next morning she wakes up
  and recalls her previous night’s activities. Sarah needs a way to revert the changes she made.

## 2. Alex P.

### Scenarios

- Alex has been given a classroom for his first class. Alex wants his classroom to be a welcoming and safe environment
  that will help promote learning. The shape of the room is a simple square and has numerous desks and bookcases. Alex
  has always been interested in Feng Shui and would like to apply it to his classroom. He would arrange everything
  himself, but with so many desks and bookcases, it's a lot to juggle. And a program could do it in seconds.
- The school administrators take note of Alex’s unique classroom layout, and they raise concerns regarding the fire
  safety of the room. Alex assures them that the layout does not inhibit any evacuation routes, and does not block any
  fire extinguishers or fire alarms. Alex needs to flag areas in his layout as “do not block” zones.

Jonathan is a 20-year-old college student.

Jonathan is a sophomore business finance student at a 4-year university. He just moved into a new apartment after moving
out of the dorms and needs to purchase furniture and set up his new apartment. Jonathan lives by himself, and his new
apartment has a very small living room and kitchen area. Jonathan is not an outdoors type of person, and spends most of
his free time inside.

Jonathan does not have a particularly busy schedule, leaving him ample time to play his favorite video games. He has
several friends that live nearby who he hopes will visit often to play video games and watch movies. He sometimes has
trouble focusing on his schoolwork, and likes to keep his bedroom as a work area, and living room as leisure area.

### Scenarios

- Jonathan has had a busy week and finds himself still needing to setup his living room. He needs to move three pieces
  of furniture around, but doesn’t feel like moving things back and forth until he finds a placement that works.
  Jonathan needs to quickly import a rough sketch of his living room into the website and add the furniture pieces he
  wants to arrange. Then he can preview layouts and select the one that works.
