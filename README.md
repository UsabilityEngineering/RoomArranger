# RoomArranger

RoomArranger aims to create a new paradigm of automated furniture layouts. RoomArranger will be able to take in a room's
current layout and will be able to recommend more efficient layouts, as well as provide Feng Shui insights.

# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

**Executive Summary**

* Analyzed competitor software to determine possible strengths and weakness in our plan.
* Created personas to represent possible end-users for our program.
* Crafted scenarios with the personas, defining user goals, expectations, and interactions we should consider for the
  UI.
* Created wireframe layouts depicting possible UI configurations.
* Began arranging wireframe layouts to experiment with designing the user experience (UX).

# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

**Executive Summary**

**Wireframes & Visual Functionality**

- Created Wireframes to understand and demonstrate the app’s desired functionality.
- Incorporated feedback from students and software engineers to refine the design.

**Cognitive Walkthroughs & User Navigation**

- Conducted parallel cognitive walkthroughs using persona perspectives and scenarios.
- Addressed several minor navigational issues reported by student feedback.

**Layout Planner**

- We found that users struggled with visualizing the abstract functionality of the layout planner.
- We added several additional icons, images, and copy text to the editor page wireframe to aid in demonstrating the
  planner’s intended functionality.

**File Formats & Sketch Uploads**

- Most users were confused by the suggested CSV, JSON, and XML file formats for the upload feature.
- We modified the layout to only suggest importing a .roomarranger file, which will be generated when exporting a
  layout.
- Many users expected to be able to upload a drawing of their layout, despite it not being a defined feature. We have
  added the feature to the layout, but we are unsure if the development team will have the time or resources to
  implement it.
