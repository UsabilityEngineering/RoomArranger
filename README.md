# RoomArranger

RoomArranger aims to create a new paradigm of automated furniture layouts. RoomArranger will be able to take in a room's
current layout and will be able to recommend more efficient layouts, as well as provide Feng Shui insights.

## UX Team Members

* **[Braden Nicholson](https://usabilityengineering.github.io/ux-portfolio-bradenn/)** - Made personas, user stories,
  sketches, made prototypes, created the prototype style guide, and designed aspects of the user tests.
* **[Luke Burkhardt](https://github.com/UsabilityEngineering/ux-portfolio-burkhardtluke)** - Introduction, conclusions, persona, scenario, sketches.

# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

**Executive Summary**

* Analyzed competitor software to determine possible strengths and weakness in our plan.
* Created personas to represent possible end-users for our program.
* Crafted scenarios with the personas, defining user goals, expectations, and interactions we should consider for the
  UI.
* Created wireframe layouts depicting possible UI configurations.
* Began arranging wireframe layouts to experiment with designing the user experience (UX).

# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

**Executive Summary**

**Wireframes & Visual Functionality**

- Created Wireframes to understand and demonstrate the app’s desired functionality.
- Incorporated feedback from students and software engineers to refine the design.

**Cognitive Walkthroughs & User Navigation**

- Conducted parallel cognitive walkthroughs using persona perspectives and scenarios.
- Addressed several minor navigational issues reported by student feedback.

**Layout Planner**

- We found that users struggled with visualizing the abstract functionality of the layout planner.
- We added several additional icons, images, and copy text to the editor page wireframe to aid in demonstrating the
  planner’s intended functionality.

**File Formats & Sketch Uploads**

- Most users were confused by the suggested CSV, JSON, and XML file formats for the upload feature.
- We modified the layout to only suggest importing a .roomarranger file, which will be generated when exporting a
  layout.
- Many users expected to be able to upload a drawing of their layout, despite it not being a defined feature. We have
  added the feature to the layout, but we are unsure if the development team will have the time or resources to
  implement it.

# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

**Executive Summary**

An executive summary for Phase III that describes your user test and what new things you learned and recommend from the
analysis. This can also include how the findings influenced updates to your design artifacts (e.g. adding/changing
scenarios, influencing wireframe workflow, etc.)

**Prototype**

- We finalized the design and functionality of our mock-up prototype.
- We began implementing visual adjustments from our previous analysis.

**User Testing**

- We created a comprehensive testing procedure for determining the efficacy our prototype.
- We completed the requisite paperwork required for approval of a user study.
